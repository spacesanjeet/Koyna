Koyna
=====
<b>A discord chat bot.</b>
<p>Koyna is a beta bot which is mainly used to test the latest updates before they are pushed to Bisly. She is mostly online and can be used to test some commands which are still in development and are not on the main bot, Bisly.</p>
<p>Koyna is a chat bot made with <b>javascript</b> and the library used is <b>discord.js</b>.</p>
<p>It is a general purpose bot with constant uptime. It is a next line of bot after I made Bisly.</p>

<p>Commands are generally scattered over a number of categories. This repository is not maintained regularly just because it serves as a beta bot for the main bot for testing purposes. Thank you. ^_^.</p>
